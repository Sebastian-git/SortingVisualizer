The following website will implement sorting algorithms with JavaScript and will show them in action with ThreeJS, making unique sounds for each piece of sorted content.

Website is deployed live at https://visualsorting-424ef.web.app/ and a decorated readme is in progress.

# <a name="title" /> Sorting Visualizer

## Introduction
This project was inspired by the content from the YouTube channel [Timo Bingmann](https://www.youtube.com/c/TimoBingmann/videos). I hope this website can help simplify the process of understanding sorting algorithms for future students.
